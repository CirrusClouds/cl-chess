# cl-chess

A (slightly buggy) Chess game written in CL utilising CLOS and bitboard arithmetic. 

This was before I discovered the fset library so a lot of the storage utilises association lists which are not nearly as nice as maps.
I plan to heavily refactor this one at some point but at least it works!

Also todo includes a coordinate parser so that there isn't a need to always do bitwise arithmetic in my head
